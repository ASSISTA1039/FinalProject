  RecordInfo: 'Sample IV stopped responding to bodily functions, leaving large burn
    marks on the surface of the head and a slight shift of the organs to the right,
    cause of death: brain death


    Subject V was forcibly aroused due to strong
    environmental stimuli received by UnderWorld, exceeding the threshold of the
    "pain factor". Note: Forced arousal can cause serious mental damage to the subject
    and should not be used unless under exceptional circumstances.


    Sample II
    has ceased to function, no external features are apparent, cause of death: severe
    internal brain damage.


    The shaken light data still cannot be accurately
    calculated and extracted, and the arithmetic power is largely affected by the
    particular circumstances, which still leaves a gap in accuracy and permanence.'
